# Csharp-Library
I made a library from bits of code from my old projects.  It's helpful for making small MVVM WPF programs.  It's still a work in progress

Dependencies are json.net ,Ookii.Dialogs, MongoDB C# drivers depending on which parts of the library are used

Folder  | Description
------------- | -------------
Common  | General C# functions.  No dependencies (except .net)
Common Dialogs  | Functions for creating dialogs
Common Excel | Functions for MS Excel using MS Interop
Common Mongo | Functions for MongoDB
Common Json | A couple of functions for saving/loading json files
CommonUI | Lots of general WPF stuff
WpfControls | Demo of custom UI Controls
WpfProjectTemplate | A template project for WPF in MVVM style
